Odin Recipes Project

This is a template website project for the HTML component of The Odin Project's foundation course.

It is not going to be very fancy (let's embrace brutalist web design for this one), but it will function just like an online recipe page.

Our index.html homepage will contain links to a few recipe pages.
Each recipe page will contain ingredients and the steps to make that recipe.

Sounds simple, right? Let's get to it!
